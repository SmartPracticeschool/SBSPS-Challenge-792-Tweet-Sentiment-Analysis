1.language:python,html,css
2.deep learning concepts

Installing
----------
1.anaconda notebook
2.spyder for flask application
steps:
1.Data  Collection
2.Text Pre-processing
3.Model Building
4.Application Building


until finished
--------------
The output shows whether the tweet is a emotionally positive,negative or neutral.

Running the tests
-----------------
1.import the saved model .h5 file into the flask application script.py 
2.pickle file into the flask application script.py
3.boot up the flask server it will give you the address and port its running on(by typing in the console :python script.py)
 But the address could be:
 http://127.0.0.1:5000
